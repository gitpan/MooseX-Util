NAME
    MooseX::Util - Moose::Util extensions

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of MooseX::Util - released March
    03, 2014 as part of MooseX-Util.

SYNOPSIS
        use MooseX::Util qw{ ensure_all_roles with_traits };

        # profit!

DESCRIPTION
    This is a utility module that handles all of the same functions that
    Moose::Util handles. In fact, most of the functions exported by this
    package are simply re-exports from Moose::Util, so you're recommended to
    read the documentation of that module for a comprehensive view.

    However.

    We've reimplemented a number of the functions our parent provides, for a
    variety of reasons. Those functions are documented here.

FUNCTIONS
  with_traits(<classname> => (<trait1>, ... )
    Given a class and one or more traits, we construct an anonymous class
    that is a subclass of the given class and consumes the traits given.
    This is exactly the same as "with_traits" in Moose::Util, except that we
    use "create_anon_class" in MooseX::Util::Meta::Class to construct the
    anonymous class, rather than "create_anon_class" in Moose::Meta::Class
    directly.

    Essentially, this means that when we do:

        my $anon_class_name = with_traits('Zombie::Catcher', 'SomeTrait');

    For $anon_class_name we get:

        Zombie::Catcher::__ANON__::SERIAL::1

    Rather than:

        Moose::Meta::Class::__ANON__::SERIAL::1

    This is nice because we have an idea of where the first anonymous class
    came from, whereas the second one could could be from anywhere.
