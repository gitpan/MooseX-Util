Revision history for MooseX-Util

	* Initial release
	* we only override with_traits() at this point (in MX::Utils), in order to
	  use our slightly nicer set of anonymous role name picking
	* also includes MooseX::Traitor, and the various meta-bits needed to do
	  the above.  Traitor aims to be a MX::Traits alternate, but right now
	  it's pretty limited.
